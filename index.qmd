:::{#hero-heading}

Hi! I am a biostatistician with research interests in developing and applying causal inference methods to medical research. 

Since 11/2023, I have been a Junior Professor in Biostatistics at team EpiDermE, Institut Mondor of Biomedical Research (INSERM U955), University Paris XII.


## Education

Previously, I received a BSc. (Hons) in Mathematics at The Open University (UK), a Master in Comparative Effectiveness Research at University Paris Cité (France) and a Pharm.D. at Hanoi University of Pharmacy (Vietnam).

In 2020, I completed a PhD in Biostatistics jointly from Ghent University (Belgium) and University Paris Cité (France). My PhD research was funded by the European Union H2020 program. I then received three years of postdoctoral training at Wharton Department of Statistics and Data Science, University of Pennsylvania (USA).

## Research Interest

My current works primarily concern the development of novel approaches for data fusion, mediation analysis, meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessment. More recently, I have been working on methods to address unmeasured confounders, policy learning and indirect treatment comparisons. 

One important feature of my research is the application of semi-parametric theory to develop flexible, data-adaptive estimation strategies for causal parameters. I am also interested in the applications of causal methods to clinical questions in medicine, psychology and pharmacoepidemiology.
