I am a biostatistician with research interests in developing and applying causal inference methods to medical research.\nSince 11/2023, I have been a Junior Professor in Biostatistics at team EpiDermE, Institut Mondor of Biomedical Research (INSERM U955), University Paris XII.\n\n\nPreviously, I received a BSc. (Hons) in Mathematics at The Open University (UK), a Master in Comparative Effectiveness Research at University Paris Cité (France) and a Pharm.D. at Hanoi University of Pharmacy (Vietnam).\nIn 2020, I completed a PhD in Biostatistics jointly from Ghent University (Belgium) and University Paris Cité (France). My PhD research was funded by the European Union H2020 program. I then received three years of postdoctoral training at Wharton Department of Statistics and Data Science, University of Pennsylvania (USA).\n\n\n\nMy current works primarily concern the development of novel approaches for data fusion, mediation analysis, meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessment. More recently, I have been working on methods to address unmeasured confounders, policy learning and indirect treatment comparisons.\nOne important feature of my research is the application of semi-parametric theory to develop flexible, data-adaptive estimation strategies for causal parameters. I am also interested in the applications of causal methods to clinical questions in medicine, psychology and pharmacoepidemiology."

    "text": "Causal Data Fusion\nData fusion refers to the integration of data and knowledge from multiple sources to improve statistical inference. Across many research fields, it has become increasingly important to combine information from several databases in order to strengthen evidence generation. Within this area, our work focuses on developing new methods to address heterogeneity and limited access to individual-level data when borrowing information across populations, particularly in the context of evidence synthesis, federated learning and health technology assessment."

    "text": "Causal Mediation Analysis\nMediation analysis encompasses a class of statistical methods designed to evaluate the role of intermediate variables in explaining the relationship between a treatment and an outcome. Our research aims to develop novel methods to address intermediate confounding in mediation analyses and to combine indirect effect estimates across multiple mediation studies. We also investigate common pitfalls in current mediation practice and propose methodological strategies to improve the quality and reliability of future analyses."

    "text": "Addressing Confounding Bias\nFinally, our team is particularly interested in developing new methodologies, as well as extending and improving existing approaches, to address both measured and unmeasured confounding. Current projects include methods that combine matching and countermatching in nested case–control designs, extensions of difference-in-differences designs to survival outcomes, and the development of alternative approaches when the parallel trends assumption underlying difference-in-differences is violated."
